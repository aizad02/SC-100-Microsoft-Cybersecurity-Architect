# Secure Infrastructure

Contoso Ltd. recently acquired Tailwind Traders, which still uses local file servers for storage. As the cybersecurity architect of Contoso Ltd., you want to evaluate a solution to secure these file servers with your existing cloud environment. Tailwind Traders provided you with a test server (The Lab VM 2) that you can use for the implementation of your POC. In this exercise, you will set up the server and integrate it into your cloud infrastructure and security environment using Azure Arc and send server logs to Defender for Cloud.

## Part 1: Design a solution (required)

In this task you´ll design a concept to secure on premise environment inside your cloud infrastructure.

### Design approach

The initial step involves analyzing the requirements based on the described scenario, understanding the objectives and defining the requirements.

Based on the provided use-case, the following requirements can be outlined:

- Enable Defender for Cloud on your subscription
- On premises servers need to be secured
- Logs should be stored, that Contoso´s SIEM Solution can process them
- Assess the compliance state of deploy resources

In the second step examine Contoso Ltd.'s existing environment. Defender for Cloud provides recommendations to secure cloud and on-premises resources by identifying steps to improve configuration and deployment. By actively monitoring workloads, it enhances overall security posture and reduces exposure to threats.

### Proposed solution

|Requirement|Solution|Action plan|
|----|----|----|
|Enable Defender for Cloud on your subscription| Defender for Cloud | Activate Defender plans in Defender for Cloud |
|On premises servers need to be secured | Azure Arc | Onboard the on premise Server to the cloud enviroment |
|Logs need to be stored, that Contoso´s SIEM Solution can process them |Defender for Cloud, DataCollectionRules, AzureMonitoring Agent, Log Analytics workspace | Create a Data Collection Rule to gather logs from Contoso´s on premise Server |
|Assess the compliance state of deploy resources | Defender for Cloud Security policies| Enable the NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5 Compliance and assesses your compliance state.|

## Part 2: Implement the solution (optional)

### Task 1: Create a Log Analytics Workspace

In this task, you´ll create a log analytics workspace which is required to house the data that is send from different resources.

1. Log into the Client 1 VM (LON-SC1) as the **lon-sc1\admin** account. The password should be provided by your lab hosting provider.
1. Open **Microsoft Edge**, select the address bar, navigate to **`https://portal.azure.com`** and log into the Azure Portal as user **User1-*******@LODSUATMCA.onmicrosoft.com** (where ****** is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider). User´s password should be provided by your lab hosting provider.
1. On the Stay signed in? dialog box, select the Don’t show this again checkbox and then select **No**.
1. Close the password save dialog from the bottom by selecting Never, to not save the default global admins credentials in your browser.
1. Cancel Welcome to Microsoft Azure screen.
1. Select **Create a resource** and search for **log analytics workspace**
1. Find the **Log Analytics Workspace tile**, select **Create**.
1. On Create Log Analytics workspace site, create a new **Resource Group** and name it **`ContosoRG`**.
1. In Instance details enter the name **`ContosoLA`**, select **East US** for region.
1. Select **Review & Create**
1. Select **Create** to start the deployment.

You successfully created the log analytics workspace.

### Task 2: Enable Defender for Cloud

Before Defender for Cloud can apply protections to your assets you have to enable the Defender plans for the resource types you want to secure.

1. You should still be logged into the Azure portal **https://portal.azure.com**.
1. Search for **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and open it.
1. In the left navigation pane, expand **Management** and select **Environment settings**.
1. Select **Expand all** and select your Subscription.
1. If the Subscription is shown as **unregistered** reload the page.
1. Select the ellipses (...) next to the subscription and select **Edit settings**.
1. Under **Cloud Workload Protection** set the **Servers** plan the slider on the right to **On**.
1. Select **Save** on top of the page.

When enabling the Plan for Servers you could see that Defender for Cloud supports many more resource types.

### Task 3: Enable the on premise Server in Azure Arc

Azure Arc is required so that it can be used to send data to the log analytics workspace that Defender for Cloud uses.

1. Swap to VM **LON-SC2** and sign into the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com`**.
1. Search for **`Azure Arc`** and open it.
1. In the left hand navigation pane, expand **Azure Arc resources** and select **Machines**.
1. Select **Add/Create** > **Add Machine**.
1. Under Add a single server, select **Generate script**.
1. In the Resource group field, use the drop-down menu to select **ContosoRG**.
1. In the Region field, use the drop-down menu to select **East US**.
1. Select **Download and run script**.
1. Select **Download** and run script on your second Lab Client **LON-SC2** to onboard the on-premise Server to Azure.
1. Run Windows PowerShell as an administrator. To do this, use the right mouse key to select the Windows icon on the bottom right corner of the window and select **Windows PowerShell(Admin)**
1. Set the Execution Policy to unrestricted.

    ```Powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
    ```

1. On the PowerShell windows, select Y
1. Run the onboarding script. To do this, select file explorer. It should take you to the downloads folder on the local C drive of the server VM. Use the right mouse key to select the file **OnboardingScript** and select **Run with **PowerShell**.
1. When the authentication popup appears, log in with the same account you are using for the Azure portal.
1. Wait till the script is successfully completed.
1. Go back to LON-SC1 and open Azure Arc.
1. Select **Machines**, select **Refresh** on top of the page and validate your server is successfully deployed to Azure Arc.

You have successfully enabled Azure Arc on the test server and data should start to flow into the log analytics workspace. This process might take some time until you can see anything in the dashboard.

### Task 4: Add Server to Defender for Cloud and gather Logs.

You´ll deploy a Data collection rule to get event logs from the on premise server. The rule will automatically deploy the monitoring agent on the server and forward logs to the previously created log analytics workspace.

1. You should still be logged into the Azure portal **https://portal.azure.com**.
1. Open Defender for Cloud.
1. In the left navigation pane, expand **Management** and select **Environment settings**.
1. Select **Expand all**.
1. You will see the previously created log analytics workspace, **ContosoLA**.  
1. Select the ellipses (...) for the **ContosoLA** line item, then select **Edit settings**.
1. Set the **Servers** plan the slider on the right to **On**.
1. Select **Save** on top of the page.
1. Use the search bar at the top to search for **Data collection rules**, then select it from the search results.
1. Select **Create**.
1. - Rule Name: **`ContosoDCR`**
   - Resource group: **ContosoRG**
1. Select **Next: Resources**.
1. Select **Add resources**. Expand the scope of the resource group. Check the previously onboarded Azure Arc machine, select **Apply**.
1. Select **Next: Collect and deliver**.
1. Select **Add data source**.
1. Choose Data Source type **Windows Event Logs**.
1. Select every option under **Configure the event logs and levels to collect:**.
1. Select **Next: Destination**.
1. Select **Add Destination**.
   - Destination type: **Azure Monitor Logs**
   - Account or namespace: **ContosoLA**
1. Select **Add data source**.
1. Select **Review & create**.
1. Select **Create**.

It may take a few hours till the resource is fully onboarded in Defender for Cloud. The next step is to look at the recommendation that Defender for Cloud generates for this resource.

### Task 5: Add regulatory compliance standard

Based on the recommendation you can start to secure the resource and assign security policies e.g. NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5 to ensure that the resources of Tailwind traders comply with our compliance regulations.

1. You should still be logged into the Azure portal **https://portal.azure.com**.
1. Open Defender for Cloud expand **Management** and select **Environment settings**.
1. Select **Expand all**.
1. Select the ellipses (...) next to the subscription and select **Edit settings**.
1. Select **Security policies** in the navigation menu on the left. The list might take a while to load.
1. Search for **`NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5`**. Change the status slider to **On**.
1. Go back to Defender for Cloud, expand **Cloud security**, then select **Regulatory compliance**.

Due to limitation off the lab environment, you are not able to see the resources as well as the compliance recommendations. It takes a while until the deployed resources are visible in Defender for Cloud.

In the Regulatory compliance dashboard you can now review any failing assessments that appear in the dashboard to understand the details of the recommendations.

By continuously assessing resources against these controls, Defender for Cloud identifies issues that may hinder achieving specific compliance certifications. Maintaining regulatory compliance is crucial for safeguarding your organization’s data and ensuring a secure cloud environment.
