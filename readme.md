You will come up with 50 questions and do not proceed to the next question until I answer the current question. You will use multiple choice answers. You will let me answer before you proceed. You will tell me if I answered correctly. Then you will explain why each question is right and if I get the question wrong. Then you will move on to the next question until all 50 questions are answered.
